# ☂️ Google Umbrella (Concept Store)

**"Innovation. Under Every Shade."**

A premium, concept e-commerce experience imagining what it would look like if Google engineered the ultimate smart umbrella. This project showcases modern web design trends, complex CSS animations, and a seamless shopping experience using React.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Google Umbrella is a fully responsive single-page application (SPA) built with **React** and **Vite**. It features a distinct "Beige & Tobacco" aesthetic, moving away from standard tech blues to a more sophisticated, fashion-forward color palette.

The site is packed with interactive elements, from a 3D-floating hero slideshow to a scroll-triggered dark mode transition that immerses the user as they discover the product's history.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Dynamic Home Page**:
    *   **3D Hero Slideshow**: A floating, rotating image carousel with smooth crossfade transitions.
    *   **Scroll-Linked Dark Mode**: The background seamlessly transitions to a dark theme when scrolling through the "Milestone" section.
    *   **Animated Statistics**: Numbers count up (1st, 4+, 100%) as they enter the viewport.
    *   **Scroll Reveal**: Elements fade in and slide up dynamically as you browse.
*   **E-Commerce Functionality**:
    *   **Shop Page**: Grid layout with product filtering and search capabilities.
    *   **Product Details**: In-depth view with an interactive review system.
    *   **Smart Cart System**: Persistent shopping cart (via LocalStorage) with quantity management.

*   **User Experience**:
    *   **Profile Dashboard**: A dedicated user area for orders and settings.
    *   **Support Center**: FAQ and contact form with validation.
    *   **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring a great experience on all devices.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Frontend Framework**: React (Vite) for blazing fast performance.

*   **Styling**: Vanilla CSS3 with extensive use of:
    *   CSS Variables (Theming)
    *   Keyframe Animations
    *   CSS Grid & Flexbox
    *   Backdrop Filters & Gradients
